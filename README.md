# `Cream`

The Open Source CRM System of your _Dreams_!
-->

## Why?

There is no shortage of Commercial Web-based CRM systems
and a few _existing_ Open Source systems.


## What?

+ Mobile-first for on-the-go at-your-fingertips access and real-time updates.
+ Drag-and-drop interface on desktop
+ Collaborative
+ Access Controls restrict access to data for security & privacy.
+ Anonimised data

## Who?

## How?

Our goal is to make a CRM that _any_ business can use
to _safely/securely_ store the details of the prospective customers.

+ [x] Security by `default`
  + [x] App does not _start_ if API keys are not present.
+ [x]


In addition to having encryption of all sensitive/personal data


## Requirements / Roadmap

### Access Controls

By default each account should have a

+ Super Admin
+ Admin
+ Regular "User"
+ Read-only access (_for audit and training purposes_)



### Data Export

+ [] Easy data export (SQL Dump) of complete data to _authorised_ person.

> Note" we will require a "GDPR form" to be completed by the data controller
  and **evidence** that the person is registered
  with the relevant data protection authority
  before we run the `export` script for their data.


## One-Click Start (Zero "Setup")







## Keyboard Shortcuts

While we need to make the CRM as user-friendly and intuitive as possible
for _first-time_ and _casual_ users, it's the "_power users_" who will
be interacting with the system _most_ and need the _fastest_ UX day-to-day.
