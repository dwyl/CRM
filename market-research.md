# Market Research

The purpose of this doc is to have _comprehensive_
[Market research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_research)
of CRM systems for the following reasons:

1. To know **what** `else` is available and ***why*** people/teams would
want to use the product/service.
2. To _understand_ what features are considered essential vs. "nice to have".
3. Test UX of the widest possible range of products/services
to determine which is most intuitive/user-friendly.



## Comparison Table

<!--

## Commercial / Closed Source

> Meta: should this list be Alphabetical or in order of Popularity?
(_I get the feeling that Alphabetical will make locating an entry easier
and thus aid maintenance ..._)
